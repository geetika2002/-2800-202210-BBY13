                    <p>Sustainable materials are ones that can be produced in various volumes without the use of
                        non-renewable resources (e.g. plastic); they essentially grow naturally. These materials prevent
                        unneccessary wastage and pollution in our environment during mass constructions, and/or small
                        time renovations. </p>

                <div class="faq-body">
                    <p>Remember that sustainable materials are usually grown naturally, but many materials are not. A
                        couple examples of these include: bamboo, pre-cast slabs, recycled plastic, reclaimed/recycled
                        steel, and plant based polyurethane rigid foam. All these materials are either made from
                        renewable sources or are recycled, making them eco-friendly and waste reducing. </p>

                    <p>Working on mental health shouldn't be ranked in importanc0e according to profession, but when
                        talking about
                        sports one's mental wellness is quite underated. As we know that our mental health essentially
                        affects the way we interact and function throughout the day. So it is very important that
                        athletes practice their mental health on a daily basis to ensure success in their profession.
